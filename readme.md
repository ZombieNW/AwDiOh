## _Generate basic facial animation from voiceover_

![Language](https://badgen.net/badge/language/Python/yellow) ![License](https://badgen.net/badge/language/MIT/red)

# What?
This generates a .mp4 of basic facial animation data from a .wav input. I made this tool to help automate some of my animation processes for my videos.

# How?
1. Install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python main.py <wav_file>`
